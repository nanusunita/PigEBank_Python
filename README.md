### Pig-E.-Bank
I used Python to wrangle and analyze the data. I made a report which shows my analysis process and results and recommendations to key business questions from Pig E. Bank.

One of the data analysts for the sales team recently left Pig E. Bank, so I’ve agreed to take their place and help out with a customer retention project.

## Goal
Identify the top risk factors that contribute to client loss and model them in a decision tree.

## Data
Pig E. Bank's Data Set -  The data set includes customer ids, last names, credit scores, country, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, if they have a credit card, if they are an active member, estimated salary, and if they have exited from the bank.

## Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:

● Pandas: for data analysis

● Numpy: for mathematical equations

## Folders
The project files are divided between the following folders:

● 01 Project Management: Project Brief

● 02 Data: Separated into two subfolders Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frame and the data after it has been cleaned and prepared for analysis (not uploaded in Github)

● 03 Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.

● 04 Analysis: Contains the decision tree and other analysis in excel.


## Visualizations
The decision tree was created using Word document
